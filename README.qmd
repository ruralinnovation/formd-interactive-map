## Configuration

Assuming that you are using [amplify-react-frontend](https://github.com/ruralinnovation/amplify-react-frontend) as a template (via the ["Use this template"](https://github.com/new?template_name=amplify-react-frontend&template_owner=ruralinnovation&owner=ruralinnovation) button in Github) for a new application, clone the resulting repo to your local environment. The first file you should update is `package.json`. Change the value of the "name" property to reflect your project name and then run `npm install` to install dependencies (which will also automatically run the `postinstall` npm script).

For local development, copy the `.env` file to a file called `.env.development.local`. Update the value for the environment variables in `.env.development.local` as needed .


## Running Code

Run `npm run dev` to run the frontend React dev server.
